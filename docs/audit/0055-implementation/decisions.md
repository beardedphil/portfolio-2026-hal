## Decisions

- **Artifacts section format:** Used markdown link format `[filename](path)` for clarity, but clarified that plain paths are also acceptable as they are clickable in most editors
- **Placement in rules:** Added the requirement as a dedicated section in both `done-means-pushed.mdc` and `qa-audit-report.mdc` for clarity, rather than embedding it in existing workflow sections
- **Minimum artifact list:** Specified the exact list (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review, qa-report when applicable) to ensure consistency
- **Folder naming:** Explicitly required canonical folder naming (`<task-id>-<short-title-kebab>`) to ensure paths are correct and traceable
