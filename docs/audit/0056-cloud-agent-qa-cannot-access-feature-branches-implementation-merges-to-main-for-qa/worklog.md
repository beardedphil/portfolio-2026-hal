# Worklog

- Read existing rule files (`done-means-pushed.mdc`, `qa-audit-report.mdc`) to understand current structure
- Added "Cloud QA branch access limitation" section to `done-means-pushed.mdc` describing the scenario and required workflow
- Removed the conflicting "Do not merge to main" section header and content as requested
- Updated section title from "exception" to "workflow" to reflect this is the standard process for cloud agents
- Updated "Sequence: push first, then summarize" section to include merge-to-main step
- Updated "Before you reply: the gate" section to include merge-to-main step
- Added "QA on main" section to `qa-audit-report.mdc` explaining workflow for tickets marked "Merged to main for QA"
- Updated "QA completion" section to handle both standard and cloud QA workflows
- Created audit artifacts (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review)
