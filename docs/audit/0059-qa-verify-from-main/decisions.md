# Decisions

## No unrequested changes

All changes were required to meet the acceptance criteria. No unrequested changes were made.

## Approach

- Enhanced existing sections rather than restructuring the entire file to maintain consistency with current format
- Added explicit step-by-step guidance to make the workflow clear and unambiguous
- Included both high-level context (Cloud QA workflow context) and detailed steps (5-step process) to accommodate different reading styles
