# Ticket Template

Use this structure when creating tickets. Replace placeholders with concrete content.

## Ticket
- **ID**: (assigned by tool)
- **Title**: (short title)
- **Goal (one sentence)**: <what we want to achieve>
- **Human-verifiable deliverable (UI-only)**: <what a human will see/click>
- **Acceptance criteria (UI-only)**: - [ ] <AC 1> etc.
- **Constraints**: Keep task small; verification UI-only (no console).
- **Non-goals**: <out of scope>

Required: Goal, deliverable, AC with checkboxes, Constraints, Non-goals. No angle-bracket placeholders in final ticket.
