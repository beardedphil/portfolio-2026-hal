# Status Message Template

## Overview

Agents must post **consistent, scan-friendly progress updates** during ticket execution. This template ensures all status messages follow a standard format that makes progress easy to track and understand.

## When to Post Status Messages

**Post status messages:**

1. **On start** - When beginning work on a ticket
2. **After each meaningful milestone** - After completing significant steps (e.g., "Explored codebase", "Implemented feature X", "Fixed bug Y")
3. **When blocked** - Immediately when encountering blockers or waiting for external dependencies
4. **On completion** - When ticket work is finished (before moving to QA or Done)

**Posting frequency:**
- **Minimum:** Once at start, once on completion
- **Recommended:** Every 30-60 minutes of active work, or after each major milestone
- **Required:** Immediately when blocked or encountering errors

## Where to Post Status Messages

**Post status messages in:**
- **Ticket thread/chat** - The primary conversation thread where the ticket is being discussed
- **Running log** - If using a chat interface with a running log or activity feed, post there as well

**Format:** Use the template below as a copy-paste starting point, then fill in the relevant fields.

## Copy-Paste Template

```markdown
## Status Update

**Context:** [Brief 1-2 sentence description of current work context]

**State:** [Starting | In Progress | Blocked | Done]

**What I did:**
- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2
- [ ] Action item 3

**Next:**
- [ ] Next action 1
- [ ] Next action 2

**Risks:** [None | List any blockers, dependencies, or concerns]

**ETA:** [Time estimate or "Unknown" if blocked]

**Links:** [Optional: Links to relevant PRs, commits, or artifacts]
```

## Field Descriptions

### Context
- **Purpose:** Quick orientation for reviewers
- **Format:** 1-2 sentences describing what you're working on
- **Example:** "Implementing dark mode toggle button on settings page"

### State
- **Purpose:** At-a-glance progress indicator
- **Values:** `Starting`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Done`
- **Usage:** Use exactly one of these values (case-sensitive)

### What I did
- **Purpose:** Document completed work items
- **Format:** Bullet list with checkboxes (`- [x]` for completed, `- [ ]` for in-progress)
- **Guideline:** Keep items specific and actionable (e.g., "Added dark mode toggle component" not "Worked on feature")

### Next
- **Purpose:** Show upcoming work items
- **Format:** Bullet list with checkboxes (`- [ ]`)
- **Guideline:** List 2-5 immediate next steps, ordered by priority

### Risks
- **Purpose:** Surface blockers and dependencies early
- **Format:** `None` if no risks, or bullet list of concerns
- **Guideline:** Include external dependencies, missing information, or technical concerns

### ETA
- **Purpose:** Set expectations for completion time
- **Format:** Time estimate (e.g., "30 minutes", "2 hours") or `Unknown` if blocked
- **Guideline:** Be realistic; update if estimates change

### Links
- **Purpose:** Reference related artifacts, PRs, or commits
- **Format:** Optional markdown links
- **Guideline:** Include links to relevant artifacts, PRs, commits, or documentation

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting

```markdown
## Example Status Update: Starting

**Context:** Beginning implementation of dark mode toggle button on settings page.

**State:** Starting

**What I did:**
- [x] Reviewed ticket requirements and acceptance criteria
- [x] Explored existing theme system and settings page structure

**Next:**
- [ ] Create dark mode toggle component
- [ ] Integrate toggle into settings page
- [ ] Add localStorage persistence for theme preference

**Risks:** None

**ETA:** 2 hours

**Links:**
```

### Example 2: In Progress

```markdown
## Example Status Update: In Progress

**Context:** Implementing dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence.

**State:** In Progress

**What I did:**
- [x] Created `DarkModeToggle.tsx` component with switch UI
- [x] Integrated toggle into settings page layout
- [x] Added theme context provider for global theme state
- [ ] Implemented localStorage persistence (in progress)

**Next:**
- [ ] Complete localStorage persistence logic
- [ ] Test theme switching and persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

**Risks:** None

**ETA:** 45 minutes

**Links:**
- Component: `src/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx:15-42`
```

### Example 3: Blocked

```markdown
## Example Status Update: Blocked

**Context:** Blocked on localStorage persistence - need to verify existing state management approach.

**State:** Blocked

**What I did:**
- [x] Created dark mode toggle component
- [x] Integrated toggle into settings page
- [x] Added theme context provider
- [ ] Implemented localStorage persistence (blocked)

**Next:**
- [ ] Wait for clarification on state management approach
- [ ] Implement localStorage once approach is confirmed

**Risks:** 
- Need clarification: Should localStorage be managed through existing Zustand store or directly in theme context?
- Dependency: Waiting for PM review of state management approach

**ETA:** Unknown (blocked)

**Links:**
- Question posted in ticket thread
```

### Example 4: Done

```markdown
## Example Status Update: Done

**Context:** Completed dark mode toggle implementation with full persistence and accessibility support.

**State:** Done

**What I did:**
- [x] Created `DarkModeToggle.tsx` component with switch UI
- [x] Integrated toggle into settings page
- [x] Added theme context provider for global theme state
- [x] Implemented localStorage persistence
- [x] Tested theme switching and persistence across page refreshes
- [x] Verified accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [x] Committed and pushed changes to feature branch

**Next:**
- [ ] Move ticket to "Ready for QA"

**Risks:** None

**ETA:** Complete

**Links:**
- Component: `src/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx:15-67`
- Context: `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx:23-45`
- Commit: `abc1234` - "Add dark mode toggle with persistence"
```

## Best Practices

### Scan-Friendly Formatting

- **Short lines:** Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
- **Consistent labels:** Always use the exact field names (Context, State, What I did, Next, Risks, ETA, Links)
- **Bullets:** Use checkbox bullets (`- [x]` or `- [ ]`) for action items
- **Whitespace:** Add blank lines between sections for readability

### Content Guidelines

- **Be specific:** "Added dark mode toggle component" not "Worked on feature"
- **Be concise:** Each action item should be one line
- **Update regularly:** Post updates every 30-60 minutes of active work
- **Surface blockers early:** Don't wait to report blockers - post immediately

### State Transitions

- **Starting → In Progress:** After first meaningful work item completed
- **In Progress → Blocked:** When encountering blockers or waiting for dependencies
- **Blocked → In Progress:** When blocker is resolved
- **In Progress → Done:** When all work items are complete and changes are committed/pushed

## Integration with Agent Workflows

### Implementation Agents

- Post status update when starting ticket work
- Post updates after completing each major milestone (planning, implementation, testing, verification)
- Post immediately when blocked
- Post final update when moving ticket to "Ready for QA"

### QA Agents

- Post status update when starting QA review
- Post updates after completing code review, testing, and artifact verification
- Post immediately when blocking issues are found
- Post final update when moving ticket to "Human in the Loop" or back to "To-do"

### PM Agents

- Post status update when starting ticket analysis or planning
- Post updates after completing research, ticket creation, or handoff
- Post immediately when clarification is needed
- Post final update when ticket is ready for implementation

## Scope

- **Applies to:** All agent types (Implementation, QA, PM, and future agent types)
- **Enforcement:** Status messages should follow this template format for consistency
- **Flexibility:** Template fields can be omitted if not applicable (e.g., "Risks: None" can be shortened to just "Risks: None" or omitted entirely if truly no risks)
