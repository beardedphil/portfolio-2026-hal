# Ready-to-start checklist (Definition of Ready)

A ticket is ready when it can move from Unassigned to To Do.

1. **Goal present** — Non-empty, no placeholder.
2. **Human-verifiable deliverable present** — Concrete description.
3. **Acceptance criteria** — At least one `- [ ]` checkbox.
4. **Constraints + Non-goals** — Both sections with content.
5. **No placeholders** — No `<AC 1>`, `<task-id>`, etc.
6. **RED document** — A Requirement Expansion Document (RED) must exist for the ticket.
