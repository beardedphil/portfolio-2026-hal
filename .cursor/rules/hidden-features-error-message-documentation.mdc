# Hidden Features: Error Message Changes Must Be Documented

**MANDATORY:** Whenever an agent changes an error message that is shown for a hidden/locked/feature-flagged capability, they **must** document the change (what changed + why), so future agents don't misinterpret the message as a product decision.

## When This Requirement Applies

This requirement applies to **all agent types** when making changes to error messages related to hidden features:

- **Implementation agents** — Must document error message changes in their **Decisions artifact** or ticket body "Implementation notes"
- **QA agents** — Must verify that error message changes are properly documented and include notes in QA reports when reviewing such changes
- **Project Manager agents** — Must ensure error message changes are documented when reviewing implementation artifacts

## What Are "Hidden Features"?

**Hidden features** include any capability that is conditionally rendered, gated, or not yet fully available to users:

- **Feature flags** — Features behind feature flags that show error messages when disabled
- **Conditional rendering** — UI elements that are conditionally shown/hidden based on configuration
- **Permission-gated UI** — Features that require specific permissions or roles
- **"Coming soon" features** — Features that are partially implemented but not yet available
- **Locked capabilities** — Features that are intentionally disabled or restricted
- **Beta/experimental features** — Features in testing that show error messages when accessed

## Required Documentation

**MANDATORY:** When an agent changes an error message for a hidden feature, they **must** document the following information:

### 1. Previous and New Wording/Behavior

- **Previous wording/behavior:** Copy/paste the exact previous error message string(s) when practical
- **New wording/behavior:** Copy/paste the exact new error message string(s) when practical
- If the change affects multiple messages or contexts, document each one

**Example:**
```markdown
**Previous message:** "This feature is not available in your current plan. Upgrade to access advanced analytics."

**New message:** "Advanced analytics requires a Pro subscription. Contact support to upgrade."
```

### 2. Where the Message Lives

- **File path:** The exact file path where the error message is defined or rendered
- **Component/context:** The specific component, function, or context where the message appears
- **Line numbers:** When feasible, include line numbers or symbol names (per `.cursor/rules/code-location-citations.mdc`)

**Example:**
```markdown
**Location:** `src/components/FeatureGate.tsx:42-45` — `FeatureGate` component error message prop
```

### 3. Reason for the Change

Clearly state the reason for the change:

- **Bugfix** — Fixing incorrect wording, typos, or misleading information
- **Product decision** — Intentional change based on product requirements or user feedback
- **Copy tweak** — Improving clarity, tone, or user experience without changing functionality
- **Technical refactor** — Changing message as part of code refactoring or architecture changes

**Example:**
```markdown
**Reason:** Copy tweak — Improved clarity and added specific action (contact support) to guide users toward upgrade path.
```

### 4. Knock-on UX Impact

Document any user-visible impact beyond the message text itself:

- **Message visibility:** Does the user still see a message, or is it now hidden/removed?
- **UI changes:** Any changes to surrounding UI (buttons, links, icons, etc.)
- **User flow changes:** Does the change affect how users can proceed or what actions are available?
- **Support/help links:** Are support links, help text, or documentation references added/removed?

**Example:**
```markdown
**UX Impact:**
- User now sees a more actionable message with explicit "Contact support" guidance
- Support link removed from error message (moved to main help menu)
- Error toast now appears instead of inline message (changed from inline to toast notification)
```

## Where to Document

**MANDATORY:** The documentation must be placed in **one of** the following locations (choose the most appropriate):

1. **Ticket body "Implementation notes" section** — For changes made during ticket implementation
   - Add a new section: `## Implementation notes`
   - Include the error message change documentation in this section

2. **Implementation "Decisions" artifact** — For significant error message changes that affect product behavior
   - Store via HAL API: `POST /api/artifacts/insert-implementation` with `artifactType: "decisions"`
   - Title format: `Decisions for ticket <ticket-id>`
   - Include the error message change documentation in this artifact

3. **QA report "Notes" section** — For error message changes discovered or reviewed during QA
   - Include in the QA report stored via HAL API: `POST /api/artifacts/insert-qa`
   - Title format: `QA report for ticket <ticket-id>`
   - Add a "Notes" section documenting the error message change

**Documentation must include enough detail** that a future agent can reconstruct the intent and context without reading git history. Include:
- The exact message strings (before/after)
- The file location and component context
- The reason for the change
- Any UX impact

## Documentation Template

Use this template when documenting error message changes:

```markdown
## Error Message Change: [Feature Name / Component Name]

### Previous Message
[Copy/paste exact previous error message string(s)]

### New Message
[Copy/paste exact new error message string(s)]

### Location
- **File:** `[file path]:[line numbers]` — `[component/function name]`
- **Context:** [Brief description of where/when the message appears]

### Reason for Change
[One of: Bugfix / Product decision / Copy tweak / Technical refactor]
[Brief explanation of why the change was made]

### UX Impact
- [ ] Message visibility: [Still visible / Hidden / Removed]
- [ ] UI changes: [Describe any surrounding UI changes]
- [ ] User flow: [Describe any changes to user actions or flow]
- [ ] Support/help links: [Added / Removed / Changed]
- [ ] Other impact: [Any other user-visible changes]
```

## QA Review Requirements

**MANDATORY:** When QA agents review a ticket that includes error message changes for hidden features, they **must**:

1. **Verify the error message change is documented** — Check the appropriate location (ticket body, Decisions artifact, or QA report notes) for the required documentation

2. **Verify documentation completeness** — Ensure the documentation includes:
   - Previous and new message strings
   - File location and component context
   - Reason for the change
   - UX impact assessment

3. **Include error message review in QA report** — QA reports should include a section confirming:
   - Error message changes were properly documented (or "No error message changes" if none were made)
   - The documented changes match code review findings
   - Any concerns about user experience or product intent

### QA Report Template Addition

QA reports should include:

```markdown
## Hidden Features Error Message Review

**Error message changes for hidden features:** [Yes / No]

If Yes:
- [ ] Error message change is documented in: [Ticket body / Decisions artifact / QA report notes]
- [ ] Documentation includes previous and new message strings: [Yes / No]
- [ ] Documentation includes file location and component context: [Yes / No]
- [ ] Documentation includes reason for change: [Yes / No]
- [ ] Documentation includes UX impact assessment: [Yes / No]
- [ ] Concerns identified: [None / List any concerns]
```

## How to Verify (UI-Only)

Reviewers can verify this guideline is being followed by:

1. **Open the rule file:** Navigate to `.cursor/rules/hidden-features-error-message-documentation.mdc` in the repository
2. **Confirm the guideline exists:** The file should contain the full guideline with all required sections
3. **Check ticket artifacts:** When reviewing tickets, check that error message changes are documented in:
   - Ticket body "Implementation notes" section, OR
   - Implementation "Decisions" artifact (via HAL app), OR
   - QA report "Notes" section (via HAL app)
4. **Verify documentation completeness:** The documentation should include all four required elements:
   - Previous/new message strings
   - File location and component context
   - Reason for change
   - UX impact

**No external tools required** — All verification can be done through the repository file system and HAL app UI.

## Scope

- Applies to **all agents** (implementation, QA, PM) when error message changes for hidden features are involved
- The documentation must be **human-verifiable** — a reviewer can open the ticket body, Decisions artifact, or QA report and immediately see what changed and why
- When in doubt, **document the change** — it's better to over-document than to leave future agents guessing whether an error message change was intentional or accidental
