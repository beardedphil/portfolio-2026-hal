# Cloud Agents: Pull from Main Before Starting

**MANDATORY:** Cloud agents (Implementation and QA) **MUST** pull the latest code from `main` before starting any work. Do not assume you have the latest code.

## Required first step

Before making changes, running tests, or loading instructions:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

- **Implementation agents:** Then create or checkout your feature branch and proceed.
- **QA agents:** Then proceed with loading instructions and QA workflow.

## Never Work on Detached HEAD or Wrong Branch

**MANDATORY:** Agents must **never** perform work on detached HEAD or a non-ticket branch. All work must be performed on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

### If You Discover Work on the Wrong Branch

If you discover that work has landed on the wrong branch (detached HEAD, `main`, or a different feature branch), you **MUST** immediately fix this:

1. **Identify the commit hash(es)** of the work that was done on the wrong branch:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5  # Find the commit hash(es) to move
   ```

2. **Create or checkout the correct feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # If branch doesn't exist
   # OR
   git switch <ticket-branch>       # If branch already exists
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the commit(s) to the correct branch:**
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   # If multiple commits, cherry-pick each one or use a range:
   git cherry-pick <first-hash>^..<last-hash>
   ```

4. **Push the corrected branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <ticket-branch>
   ```

5. **If work was already committed on the wrong branch, you may need to reset that branch:**
   ```bash
   # Only if you need to remove commits from the wrong branch
   git checkout <wrong-branch>
   git reset --hard <commit-before-wrong-work>
   git push --force origin <wrong-branch>  # Use with caution
   ```

**CRITICAL:** Do not continue working until the branch situation is corrected. All commits must be on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

### If You Discover Uncommitted Work

If you discover that you have uncommitted changes (work that exists but hasn't been committed yet), you **MUST** preserve this work by creating or switching to the correct feature branch:

#### Case 1: Uncommitted changes on any branch (including detached HEAD)

If you have uncommitted changes but no commits yet, create or switch to the correct feature branch to preserve your working tree:

1. **Create or switch to the correct feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git switch -c <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch and switches to it, preserving uncommitted changes
   # OR (if using older git versions)
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch and switches to it, preserving uncommitted changes
   ```

2. **Continue with your work** — your uncommitted changes are now on the correct branch and can be committed normally.

#### Case 2: Detached HEAD with uncommitted changes

If you are on a detached HEAD state with uncommitted changes, create a new branch to preserve the working tree, then commit and push:

1. **Create a new branch from the current detached HEAD state:**
   ```bash
   git switch -c <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch from current HEAD, preserving uncommitted changes
   # OR (if using older git versions)
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch from current HEAD, preserving uncommitted changes
   ```

2. **Commit your uncommitted changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial work for ticket <ticket-id>"
   ```

3. **Push the branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <ticket-branch>
   ```

**CRITICAL:** The `git switch -c` (or `git checkout -b`) command preserves uncommitted changes when creating a new branch. This ensures your work is not lost when moving to the correct branch.

## Why

Cloud agents run in an environment that may have cloned the repo earlier or from a different ref. The board and tickets reflect the current state of `main`; working from a stale clone can cause merge conflicts, duplicate work, or missed changes. Always start from an up-to-date `main`.

## Scope

- Applies to: implementation-agent, qa-agent (any agent that runs as a Cursor Cloud Agent on the repo).
- When: Before any other work on the ticket (first step after the agent starts).
