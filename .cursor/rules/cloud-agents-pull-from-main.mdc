# Cloud Agents: Pull from Main Before Starting

**MANDATORY:** Cloud agents (Implementation and QA) **MUST** pull the latest code from `main` before starting any work. Do not assume you have the latest code.

## Required first step

Before making changes, running tests, or loading instructions:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

- **Implementation agents:** Then follow the "Implementation Agent Branch Setup" section below.
- **QA agents:** Then proceed with loading instructions and QA workflow.

## Implementation Agent Branch Setup

**MANDATORY:** Implementation agents **MUST** create or switch to the feature branch and push it with upstream tracking **BEFORE** reading any files or making any code edits. This ensures work is never done on an untracked local branch.

### Step 1: Create or Switch to Feature Branch

Create a new branch using the ticket number and a descriptive name, or switch to an existing branch:

```bash
git switch -c ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

**If the branch already exists locally or remotely:**
```bash
git switch ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

### Step 2: Push Branch with Upstream Tracking

**MANDATORY:** Push the branch immediately with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

**If upstream is already set but you want to ensure it's correct:**
```bash
git push -u origin ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

This command will set the upstream tracking relationship if it doesn't exist, or update it if it does.

### Step 3: Verify Upstream is Set

**MANDATORY:** Verify that upstream tracking is correctly configured:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
```

**Expected output:**
```
origin/ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

If this command outputs the expected remote branch name, upstream tracking is correctly set. If it fails or outputs something unexpected, the upstream is not set correctly and you must run `git push -u origin <branch-name>` again.

### Why Push Early

Pushing the branch immediately after creation (before any code edits) provides several critical benefits:

- **Remote backup:** Work is backed up to the remote repository from the start, preventing loss if the local environment is reset or lost
- **CI/PR integration:** Enables continuous integration systems and pull request workflows to run from the first commit
- **Collaboration:** Other team members can see the branch exists and track progress
- **Safety:** Prevents losing work if the local branch is accidentally reset or deleted

### Safe Alternative: Branch Already Exists

If the branch already exists (either locally or remotely), use this safe workflow:

1. **Switch to the existing branch:**
   ```bash
   git switch ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
   ```

2. **Verify or set upstream tracking:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
   ```

3. **Verify upstream is set:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
   ```

This ensures upstream tracking is configured even if the branch existed before you started work.

### Critical Ordering

**DO NOT** read files, make code edits, or run any other commands until:
1. ✅ You have pulled latest from `main`
2. ✅ You have created/switched to the feature branch
3. ✅ You have pushed the branch with upstream tracking (`git push -u origin <branch-name>`)
4. ✅ You have verified upstream is set (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}`)

Only after all four steps are complete should you proceed with reading files, making code changes, or any other implementation work.

## Never Work on Detached HEAD or Wrong Branch

**MANDATORY:** Agents must **never** perform work on detached HEAD or a non-ticket branch. All work must be performed on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

### If You Discover Work on the Wrong Branch

If you discover that work has landed on the wrong branch (detached HEAD, `main`, or a different feature branch), you **MUST** immediately fix this:

1. **Identify the commit hash(es)** of the work that was done on the wrong branch:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5  # Find the commit hash(es) to move
   ```

2. **Create or checkout the correct feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # If branch doesn't exist
   # OR
   git switch <ticket-branch>       # If branch already exists
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the commit(s) to the correct branch:**
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   # If multiple commits, cherry-pick each one or use a range:
   git cherry-pick <first-hash>^..<last-hash>
   ```

4. **Push the corrected branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <ticket-branch>
   ```

5. **If work was already committed on the wrong branch, you may need to reset that branch:**
   ```bash
   # Only if you need to remove commits from the wrong branch
   git checkout <wrong-branch>
   git reset --hard <commit-before-wrong-work>
   git push --force origin <wrong-branch>  # Use with caution
   ```

**CRITICAL:** Do not continue working until the branch situation is corrected. All commits must be on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

## Why

Cloud agents run in an environment that may have cloned the repo earlier or from a different ref. The board and tickets reflect the current state of `main`; working from a stale clone can cause merge conflicts, duplicate work, or missed changes. Always start from an up-to-date `main`.

## Scope

- Applies to: implementation-agent, qa-agent (any agent that runs as a Cursor Cloud Agent on the repo).
- When: Before any other work on the ticket (first step after the agent starts).
