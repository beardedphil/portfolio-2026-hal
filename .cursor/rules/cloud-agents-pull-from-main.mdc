# Cloud Agents: Pull from Main Before Starting

**MANDATORY:** Cloud agents (Implementation and QA) **MUST** pull the latest code from `main` before starting any work. Do not assume you have the latest code.

## Required first step

Before making changes, running tests, or loading instructions:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

- **Implementation agents:** Then follow the "Implementation Agent Branch Setup" section below to create/switch to your feature branch, push it immediately with upstream tracking, and verify upstream is set **before** reading files or making any code edits.
- **QA agents:** Then proceed with loading instructions and QA workflow.

## Implementation Agent Branch Setup

**MANDATORY:** Implementation agents **MUST** create or switch to the feature branch and push it immediately with upstream tracking **before** reading files or making any code edits. This ensures work is never done on an untracked local branch.

### Step 1: Create or Switch to Feature Branch

Determine your feature branch name from the ticket (typically `ticket/<id>-<short-title-kebab>` format, e.g., `ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early`).

#### If the branch does not exist

```bash
git switch -c ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
# Alternative for older git versions: use checkout -b instead
git checkout -b ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

#### If the branch already exists

```bash
git switch ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
# Alternative for older git versions: use checkout instead
git checkout ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

### Step 2: Push Branch with Upstream Tracking

**MANDATORY:** Push the branch immediately with upstream tracking (`-u` flag):

```bash
git push -u origin ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

#### If the branch already exists and upstream is missing

If you switched to an existing branch that doesn't have upstream tracking set, run the same push command:
```bash
git push -u origin ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

This will set the upstream tracking even if the branch already exists remotely.

### Step 3: Verify Upstream is Set

**MANDATORY:** Verify that upstream tracking is correctly configured:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
```

**Expected output:** The command should output something like:
```
origin/ticket/0817-add-a-rule-to-create-and-push-branch-early
```

**If the command fails or outputs nothing:** The upstream is not set. Re-run `git push -u origin <branch-name>` and verify again.

### Why Push Early?

Pushing the branch immediately (before any code edits) ensures:
- **Remote backup:** Work is backed up remotely, preventing loss if the local branch is reset or the environment is lost
- **CI/PR integration:** Enables continuous integration and pull request workflows to run from the start
- **Collaboration:** Other agents or team members can access the branch if needed
- **Work safety:** Prevents losing work if the local branch is accidentally deleted or reset

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed with reading files or making code edits until the branch is created, pushed with upstream tracking, and upstream verification succeeds.

## Never Work on Detached HEAD or Wrong Branch

**MANDATORY:** Agents must **never** perform work on detached HEAD or a non-ticket branch. All work must be performed on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

## Do Not

**MANDATORY:** The following destructive git commands are **prohibited by default** and must **never** be used unless explicitly required by the ticket:

- `git reset --hard` — Discards all uncommitted changes and resets the working directory to a specific commit
- `git clean -fd` — Removes untracked files and directories
- Force-push operations (`git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease`) — Overwrites remote branch history

### Exception: When Ticket Explicitly Requires Destructive Commands

Destructive commands are **only allowed** when **both** of the following conditions are met:

1. **The ticket explicitly requires the destructive command** — The ticket description, acceptance criteria, or instructions must clearly state that a destructive command is needed (e.g., "reset the branch to a clean state" or "force-push to fix branch history").

2. **The agent creates a backup and documents the rationale** — Before executing any destructive command, the agent **MUST**:
   - Create a backup using one of the following methods:
     - **Patch file:** `git diff > backup.patch` (for uncommitted changes)
     - **Stash:** `git stash push -m "backup before destructive operation"` (for uncommitted changes)
     - **Branch backup:** `git branch backup-<timestamp>` (for committed work that might be lost)
   - Document the rationale in the worklog or decisions artifact, explaining:
     - Why the destructive command is necessary
     - What backup was created and where it is stored
     - What will be lost and why it's acceptable

**If a destructive command is needed but the ticket doesn't explicitly require it:** The agent must **not** execute the command. Instead, the agent should document the situation and request clarification or create a follow-up ticket.

### If You Discover Work on the Wrong Branch

If you discover that work has landed on the wrong branch (detached HEAD, `main`, or a different feature branch), you **MUST** immediately fix this:

1. **Identify the commit hash(es)** of the work that was done on the wrong branch:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5  # Find the commit hash(es) to move
   ```

2. **Create or checkout the correct feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # If branch doesn't exist
   # OR
   git switch <ticket-branch>       # If branch already exists
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the commit(s) to the correct branch:**
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   # If multiple commits, cherry-pick each one or use a range:
   git cherry-pick <first-hash>^..<last-hash>
   ```

4. **Push the corrected branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <ticket-branch>
   ```

5. **If work was already committed on the wrong branch, you may need to reset that branch:**
   
   **WARNING:** This step involves destructive commands (`git reset --hard` and `git push --force`). See the "Do Not" section above for requirements.
   
   **Before proceeding:** Ensure you have created a backup branch of the work that will be removed:
   ```bash
   git branch backup-<wrong-branch>-<timestamp>  # Create backup before destructive operations
   ```
   
   **Only if you need to remove commits from the wrong branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout <wrong-branch>
   git reset --hard <commit-before-wrong-work>
   git push --force origin <wrong-branch>  # Use with caution - see "Do Not" section
   ```
   
   **Documentation required:** Document in your worklog or decisions artifact:
   - Why the reset and force-push were necessary
   - What backup branch was created
   - What commits were removed and why

**CRITICAL:** Do not continue working until the branch situation is corrected. All commits must be on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

### If You Discover Uncommitted Work

If you discover that you have uncommitted changes (work that exists but hasn't been committed yet), you **MUST** preserve this work by creating or switching to the correct feature branch:

#### Case 1: Uncommitted changes on any branch (including detached HEAD)

If you have uncommitted changes but no commits yet, create or switch to the correct feature branch to preserve your working tree:

1. **Create or switch to the correct feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git switch -c <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch and switches to it, preserving uncommitted changes
   # OR (if using older git versions)
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch and switches to it, preserving uncommitted changes
   ```

2. **Continue with your work** — your uncommitted changes are now on the correct branch and can be committed normally.

#### Case 2: Detached HEAD with uncommitted changes

If you are on a detached HEAD state with uncommitted changes, create a new branch to preserve the working tree, then commit and push:

1. **Create a new branch from the current detached HEAD state:**
   ```bash
   git switch -c <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch from current HEAD, preserving uncommitted changes
   # OR (if using older git versions)
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # Creates new branch from current HEAD, preserving uncommitted changes
   ```

2. **Commit your uncommitted changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial work for ticket <ticket-id>"
   ```

3. **Push the branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <ticket-branch>
   ```

**CRITICAL:** The `git switch -c` (or `git checkout -b`) command preserves uncommitted changes when creating a new branch. This ensures your work is not lost when moving to the correct branch.

## Why

Cloud agents run in an environment that may have cloned the repo earlier or from a different ref. The board and tickets reflect the current state of `main`; working from a stale clone can cause merge conflicts, duplicate work, or missed changes. Always start from an up-to-date `main`.

## Scope

- Applies to: implementation-agent, qa-agent (any agent that runs as a Cursor Cloud Agent on the repo).
- When: Before any other work on the ticket (first step after the agent starts).
