# Cloud Agents: Pull from Main Before Starting

**MANDATORY:** Cloud agents (Implementation and QA) **MUST** pull the latest code from `main` before starting any work. Do not assume you have the latest code.

## Required first step

Before making changes, running tests, or loading instructions:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

- **Implementation agents:** Then create or checkout your feature branch and proceed.
- **QA agents:** Then proceed with loading instructions and QA workflow.

## Why

Cloud agents run in an environment that may have cloned the repo earlier or from a different ref. The board and tickets reflect the current state of `main`; working from a stale clone can cause merge conflicts, duplicate work, or missed changes. Always start from an up-to-date `main`.

## Scope

- Applies to: implementation-agent, qa-agent (any agent that runs as a Cursor Cloud Agent on the repo).
- When: Before any other work on the ticket (first step after the agent starts).
