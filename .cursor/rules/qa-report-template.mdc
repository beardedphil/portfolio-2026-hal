# QA Report Template

**MANDATORY:** QA agents **must** use this template when publishing QA artifacts via `/api/artifacts/insert-qa`. This template ensures consistency, auditability, and explicit Acceptance Criteria verification.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy the template below** (starting from "## Ticket & Deliverable")
2. **Fill in all sections** with substantive content (no placeholder-only sections)
3. **For PASS reports:** Include explicit "AC1/AC2/..." statements with evidence for each Acceptance Criteria
4. **For FAIL reports:** Include clear repro steps, expected vs actual results, and suspected area
5. **Store via HAL API:** Use `POST /api/artifacts/insert-qa` with the filled template as `body_md`

## Template (Copy/Paste Starting Here)

```markdown
# QA Report for ticket <ticket-id>

## Ticket & Deliverable

**Goal:** [One-line goal from ticket]

**Human-verifiable deliverable:** [One-line deliverable from ticket]

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] [AC1 text from ticket]
- [ ] [AC2 text from ticket]
- [ ] [AC3 text from ticket]
[Add all ACs from ticket]

## Missing Required Implementation Artifacts

**Only include this section if artifacts are missing. If all artifacts are present, skip this section.**

**QA FAILED:** Required implementation artifacts are missing. QA cannot proceed without complete implementation artifacts.

**Missing artifacts:**
- [Artifact name] (`[Artifact title]`)
- [Artifact name] (`[Artifact title]`)

**Present artifacts:**
- [List present artifacts]

**If artifacts are missing, QA MUST FAIL. Do not proceed with code review or verification.**

## Audit Artifacts

**Only include this section if all required artifacts are present.**

All required implementation artifacts are present:
- ✅ Plan artifact (`Plan for ticket <ticket-id>`)
- ✅ Worklog artifact (`Worklog for ticket <ticket-id>`)
- ✅ Changed Files artifact (`Changed Files for ticket <ticket-id>`) — [Verify non-empty content]
- ✅ Decisions artifact (`Decisions for ticket <ticket-id>`)
- ✅ Verification artifact (`Verification for ticket <ticket-id>`)
- ✅ PM Review artifact (`PM Review for ticket <ticket-id>`)
- ✅ Git diff artifact (`Git diff for ticket <ticket-id>`)
- ✅ Instructions Used artifact (`Instructions Used for ticket <ticket-id>`)

**Changed Files artifact verification:**
- [ ] Changed Files artifact is non-empty and contains substantive content
- [ ] If files changed: Lists file paths with brief per-file descriptions (one line each)
- [ ] If no files changed: Explicitly states "No files changed." followed by a brief reason

## Code Review

**Only include this section if all required artifacts are present.**

**Status:** [PASS / FAIL]

1. **[Test Case 1: Description]**
   - **Steps:** [Step-by-step instructions]
   - **Expected:** [What should happen]
   - **Actual:** [What was observed, if tested]

2. **[Test Case 2: Description]**
   - **Steps:** [Step-by-step instructions]
   - **Expected:** [What should happen]
   - **Actual:** [What was observed, if tested]

[Add additional test cases as needed]

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

**MANDATORY:** Enumerate every Acceptance Criteria from the ticket. For each AC, state "Met" or "Not met" with evidence.

### AC 1: "[Full AC text from ticket]"
- **Status:** [Met / Not met]
- **Evidence:**
  - [File path:line range or symbol name] — [What was implemented]
  - [Artifact reference] — [Link to artifact or section]
  - [Reproduction steps] — [Steps to verify
  - [Screenshot reference] — [If applicable]

### AC 2: "[Full AC text from ticket]"

- **Evidence:**
  - [File path:line range or symbol name] — [What was implemented]
  - [Artifact reference] — [Link to artifact or section]
  - [Reproduction steps] — [Steps to verify]

[Continue for all ACs from ticket]

**If any AC is not met, QA MUST FAIL.**

## Template Requirements

### For PASS Reports

- **Must include explicit "AC1/AC2/..." statements** in the "Acceptance Criteria Verification" section
- **Must provide evidence** for each AC (file paths, artifact references, reproduction steps)
- **Must state "Met"** for all ACs
- **Must include test matrix** showing all scenarios executed
- **Must document environment** (branch, browser, OS)

### For FAIL Reports

- **Must include clear repro steps** in the "Repro Steps (For Failures Only)" section
- **Must state expected vs actual** results
- **Must identify suspected area** (file path or component)
- **Must enumerate which ACs failed** in the "Acceptance Criteria Verification" section
- **Must state "Not met"** for failed ACs with explanation

### Compatibility with Artifact Validation

- **All sections must contain substantive content** (no placeholder-only sections)
- **If a section doesn't apply, explicitly state why** (e.g., "N/A - All artifacts present" for Missing Artifacts section)
- **Template produces non-empty `body_md`** with meaningful content
- **All required headings must be present** even if content is brief

## Example Usage

See `.cursor/rules/qa-report-example.mdc` for a filled example QA report demonstrating correct usage of this template.
