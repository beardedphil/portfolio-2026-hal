# Agent Runs Terminal Commands

- **Tickets (Supabase-backed Kanban):** All ticket changes (create, update body, move column) must be made **in the DB first**, then run the sync script so docs and UI stay in sync. Do not create or edit ticket files under `docs/tickets/` directly. After Supabase changes, run `npm run sync-tickets` (or use `node scripts/move-ticket-column.js <ticketId> <columnId>` for column moves; it updates DB then runs sync).
- When a task requires running a terminal command (e.g. `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run sync-tickets`, restarting a dev server, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`), the **agent must run the command itself** when it has the ability to do so.
- **Do not ask the user** to run terminal commands that the agent can run (e.g. "Please run `npm run dev`", "Restart the HAL dev server", "Run `npm run sync-tickets` from the repo root").
- Only suggest the user run a command when the action truly requires user context (e.g. picking a folder, approving a destructive operation, or when the agent environment cannot execute the command).
- When instructing verification or follow-up, prefer steps the agent can perform (run the command, then report the result) over steps that delegate to the user.

## Keep the dev server current

- **After changes that affect the HAL app or hal-agents**, run whatever is needed so the user can test immediately:
  - Run `npm run build --prefix projects/hal-agents` if hal-agents or its consumers changed.
  - If the dev server is not running or must be restarted: kill anything on ports 5173 and 5174 (e.g. `npx --yes kill-port 5173 5174`), then run `npm run dev` (in the background so the server stays up).
- **Goal:** The dev server should always be current after an agent session—no "please run npm run dev" handoff. Start or restart dev when it makes sense so the user can open the app and test right away.
