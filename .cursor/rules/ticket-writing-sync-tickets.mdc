# Ticket Source of Truth: Supabase Only

- **No tickets can be created from outside the app** by writing files in the repo.
- **Do not create or edit ticket files** under `docs/tickets/` directly. Those files are **derived from Supabase** (DB → docs).
- **To create or change a ticket:** write it **directly into Supabase**:
  - **In-app:** Use the HAL PM agent (create_ticket / update_ticket_body). The change propagates: Kanban UI within ~10s; run sync_tickets (or `npm run sync-tickets`) to propagate to `docs/tickets/*.md`.
  - **Outside the app:** Use a script that inserts/updates the `tickets` table in Supabase (e.g. a one-off script with Supabase client). Then run `npm run sync-tickets` from the repo root so `docs/tickets/` match the database.
- **After any Supabase ticket change**, run `npm run sync-tickets` (from repo root, with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`) so `docs/tickets/*.md` are updated from the database. Commit and push any resulting repo changes if appropriate.
- **Never commit `.env`** (it must remain ignored).
