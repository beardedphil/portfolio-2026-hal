# Delete Branch After Merge to Main

- **After** a feature branch is merged into `main`, **delete that feature branch** (local and remote).
- This keeps the repo tidy and makes it clear which branches are still in progress.

## Who does it

- **Whoever performs the merge** (QA, user, or agent when explicitly asked to merge) must delete the branch after merging.
- If you merge a branch into `main` (e.g. `ticket/0012-...` or `feat/...`), run:
  - `git branch -d <branch-name>` (local delete; use `-D` only if needed)
  - `git push origin --delete <branch-name>` (remote delete)
- If you use a pull request / merge on the host (e.g. GitHub), use the host’s “Delete branch” option after the merge.

## Branch naming

- Feature branches: `ticket/<id>-<short-title-kebab>` or `feat/...`.
- Do not delete `main` or long-lived branches that are not feature branches.

## Summary

- Merge to `main` → then delete the merged feature branch (local + remote).
- Prevents accumulation of stale branch names and clarifies what’s still open.
