# Submodule Sync Protocol

## Global rules live in the HAL repo

- The **only** authoritative global agent rules are in: `portfolio-2026-hal/.cursor/rules/`.
- `projects/kanban` and `projects/hal-agents` are **normal directories** in the HAL repo (monorepo). Edit them directly; no submodule sync needed.
- If HAL later adds other submodules (e.g. `projects/project-1`), they may contain a stub rule that points back here.

## Context (0013)

`portfolio-2026-hal` is a **monorepo**. Kanban and hal-agents are vendored under `projects/`:

- `projects/kanban` — vendored (was submodule; now regular tracked files).
- `projects/hal-agents` — normal directory (agents code; single source of truth).

There are **no git submodules** in HAL after 0013. Running `npm run dev` does not require `git submodule update`.

## After Pushing to an External Repo (if you mirror)

If you maintain a separate mirror of kanban or hal-agents and push there, update that repo from HAL when needed. HAL is the source of truth; no submodule pointer to update in HAL.

## Why This Matters

- The HAL app embeds the kanban board from `projects/kanban`.
- All code is in one repo; no sync step. Fresh clone + `npm install` (root and projects/kanban if needed) + `npm run dev` is enough.
