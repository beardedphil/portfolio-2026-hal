# Agent Instructions (Local)

Instructions are loaded from `.cursor/rules` and `docs/`. See `docs/process/hal-tool-call-contract.mdc` for HAL API endpoints.

## Pre-Commit Build Verification

**MANDATORY:** Before committing ANY code changes, ALL agents **MUST** verify the build succeeds:

1. **Install dependencies (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify TypeScript compilation:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   ```
   
   This must pass with zero errors. If it fails, fix all TypeScript errors before committing.

3. **Verify full build (if making changes that affect build):**
   ```bash
   npm run build:hal
   ```
   
   **Note:** `npm run build:hal` may fail due to vite 6.x scanning node_modules during config loading (pre-existing issue). If this happens, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds instead:
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   ```
   
   If TypeScript compilation fails, you **MUST** fix the errors before committing. Do not commit code that breaks TypeScript compilation.

4. **For specific projects:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/kanban && npx tsc --noEmit  # Check kanban project specifically
   ```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **NEVER commit code without running `npx tsc -b --noEmit` first**
- **NEVER commit code that causes `npm run build:hal` to fail**
- **If build fails, fix it before committing - do not leave broken builds for others to discover**
- This applies to ALL agents (implementation, QA, PM) when making code changes

**This check prevents build failures in CI/CD and ensures code quality.**

## Moving Tickets After Implementation

**MANDATORY:** After implementation, the implementation agent **MUST** move the ticket to **Ready for QA** before sending a completion summary.

**Move ticket to Ready for QA:**
```javascript
const baseUrl = (await readFile('.hal/api-base-url', 'utf8')).trim()
const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/tickets/move`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ticketId: '0167', columnId: 'col-qa' }),
})
const result = await res.json()
if (!result.success) throw new Error(`Failed: ${result.error}`)
```

**When to move:**
1. After all code changes are committed and pushed
2. After all 8 required artifacts are stored (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review, git-diff, instructions-used)
3. **Before** sending completion summary

**If move returns `missingArtifacts`:** Store each via `POST /api/artifacts/insert-implementation`, then retry move.

**When to move (MANDATORY WORKFLOW):**
1. ✅ After all code changes are committed and pushed
2. ✅ After all required artifacts are stored (all 8: plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review, git-diff, instructions-used)
3. ✅ **Before moving:** Call get_artifacts (or POST /api/artifacts/get) and confirm all 8 required implementation artifacts are present with substantive content.
4. ✅ **MOVE THE TICKET TO READY FOR QA** (use the API call above)
5. ✅ **THEN** send your final "implementation complete" summary message

**If move returns success: false with missingArtifacts:** Store each listed artifact via POST /api/artifacts/insert-implementation with the corresponding artifactType, then retry POST /api/tickets/move. The move API will not allow moving to Ready for QA until all 8 artifacts are present.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE:** 
- **DO NOT** send a completion summary or "done" message without first moving the ticket to Ready for QA
- **DO NOT** mark the ticket as complete in your message if you haven't moved it
- The ticket move is **part of the completion workflow**, not an optional step
- If the move fails, **DO NOT** proceed with completion - fix the issue and retry the move (if missingArtifacts, store those artifacts then retry move)

**Available column IDs:**
- `col-unassigned` - Unassigned
- `col-todo` - To-do
- `col-doing` - Doing (Active Work)
- `col-qa` - Ready for QA
- `col-human-in-the-loop` - Human in the Loop
- `col-process-review` - Process Review
- `col-done` - Done
- `col-wont-implement` - Will Not Implement

**Note:** The HAL API endpoint `/api/tickets/move` uses server-side Supabase credentials, so agents don't need to provide credentials in the request body. The API uses the ticket's primary key (pk) for updates to ensure reliable ticket movement regardless of the ticket ID format provided.
