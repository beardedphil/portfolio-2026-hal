# Agent Instructions (Local)

Instructions are loaded from `.cursor/rules` and `docs/`. See `docs/process/hal-tool-call-contract.mdc` for HAL API endpoints.

## API-only Data Access (ALL Agents)

**MANDATORY:** Agents must **never** call the database directly (no direct Supabase client usage, no `@supabase/supabase-js`, no `SUPABASE_*` env vars in agent runtime).

- **All ticket operations** (create/update/move/list/get) must go through HAL endpoints under `/api/tickets/*`.
- **All artifact operations** must go through HAL endpoints under `/api/artifacts/*`.
- HAL server endpoints use **server-side privileged Supabase credentials** (e.g. `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` / service role) to bypass RLS safely.

## Pre-Commit Build Verification

**MANDATORY:** Before committing ANY code changes, ALL agents **MUST** verify the build succeeds:

1. **Install dependencies (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify TypeScript compilation:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   ```
   
   This must pass with zero errors. If it fails, fix all TypeScript errors before committing.

3. **Verify full build (if making changes that affect build):**
   ```bash
   npm run build:hal
   ```
   
   **Note:** `npm run build:hal` may fail due to vite 6.x scanning node_modules during config loading (pre-existing issue). If this happens, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds instead:
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   ```
   
   If TypeScript compilation fails, you **MUST** fix the errors before committing. Do not commit code that breaks TypeScript compilation.

4. **For specific projects:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/kanban && npx tsc --noEmit  # Check kanban project specifically
   ```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **NEVER commit code without running `npx tsc -b --noEmit` first**
- **NEVER commit code that causes `npm run build:hal` to fail**
- **If build fails, fix it before committing - do not leave broken builds for others to discover**
- This applies to ALL agents (implementation, QA, PM) when making code changes

**This check prevents build failures in CI/CD and ensures code quality.**

## Branch Management: Never Work on Detached HEAD or Non-Ticket Branches

**MANDATORY:** Agents must **never** perform work on a detached HEAD or a non-ticket branch. All work must be performed on the correct feature branch for the ticket.

### Before Starting Work

**Always verify you're on the correct branch:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

- **If you're on detached HEAD:** You **MUST** immediately create or checkout the correct feature branch before making any changes.
- **If you're on the wrong branch:** You **MUST** immediately switch to the correct feature branch before making any changes.
- **If you're on `main`:** You **MUST** create or checkout the feature branch for your ticket before making any changes.

### If Work Has Already Landed on the Wrong Branch

**If you discover that work has already been committed on the wrong branch (detached HEAD, `main`, or another branch), you MUST immediately fix it:**

1. **Identify the commit hash(es) that need to be moved:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -n 5  # Find the commit hash(es)
   ```

2. **Create or checkout the correct feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <ticket-branch>  # If branch doesn't exist
   # OR
   git switch <ticket-branch>  # If branch already exists
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the commit(s) to the correct branch:**
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   # If multiple commits:
   git cherry-pick <first-hash>^..<last-hash>
   ```

4. **Push the corrected branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <ticket-branch>
   ```

5. **If commits were made on `main` or another branch, remove them from that branch** (after confirming they're safely on the feature branch):
   ```bash
   git checkout <wrong-branch>
   git reset --hard <commit-before-wrong-work>  # Reset to before the wrong commits
   git push --force-with-lease origin <wrong-branch>  # Only if necessary and safe
   ```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **NEVER commit to detached HEAD** - always create/checkout a branch first
- **NEVER commit to `main`** - always use a feature branch
- **NEVER commit to a different ticket's branch** - always use the correct ticket branch
- **If you discover wrong-branch commits, fix them immediately** - don't continue working until the branch is correct
- **Cherry-pick is the preferred method** for moving commits to the correct branch

**This ensures all work is properly tracked, associated with the correct ticket, and can be reviewed/merged correctly.**

## Moving Tickets After Implementation

**MANDATORY:** After implementation, the implementation agent **MUST** automatically move the ticket to **Ready for QA** before sending a completion summary. **DO NOT wait for user interaction or ask for permission - just move it.**

**Move ticket to Ready for QA (AUTOMATIC - NO USER INTERACTION REQUIRED):**
```javascript
const baseUrl = (await readFile('.hal/api-base-url', 'utf8')).trim()
const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/tickets/move`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ticketId: '0167', columnId: 'col-qa' }),
})
const result = await res.json()
if (!result.success) {
  // If missing artifacts, store them and retry
  if (result.missingArtifacts && Array.isArray(result.missingArtifacts)) {
    // Store missing artifacts, then retry move
    // (implementation details in error handling below)
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Failed to move ticket: ${result.error}`)
  }
}
```

**When to move (AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW - NO USER INTERACTION):**
1. ✅ After all code changes are committed and pushed
2. ✅ After all 8 required artifacts are stored (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review, git-diff, instructions-used)
3. ✅ **Automatically call get_artifacts** (or POST /api/artifacts/get) and confirm all 8 required implementation artifacts are present with substantive content
4. ✅ **AUTOMATICALLY MOVE THE TICKET TO READY FOR QA** (use the API call above) - **DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY, DO NOT ASK USER**
5. ✅ **THEN** send your final "implementation complete" summary message

**Error Handling for Ticket Move:**
- **If move returns success: false with missingArtifacts:** Automatically store each listed artifact via POST /api/artifacts/insert-implementation with the corresponding artifactType, then automatically retry POST /api/tickets/move. The move API will not allow moving to Ready for QA until all 8 artifacts are present.
- **If move fails for other reasons:** Log the error, but **STILL ATTEMPT TO MOVE**. The system is designed to handle failures gracefully. Do not block completion - move the ticket and note any issues in your summary.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:** 
- **ALWAYS move the ticket automatically** - never ask the user for permission or wait for confirmation
- **DO NOT** send a completion summary or "done" message without first moving the ticket to Ready for QA
- **DO NOT** mark the ticket as complete in your message if you haven't moved it
- The ticket move is **part of the completion workflow**, not an optional step
- **If the move fails, retry automatically** - do not give up after one failure
- **The system is designed to handle failures** - if a move fails, it's okay, just note it and move on

**Available column IDs:**
- `col-unassigned` - Unassigned
- `col-todo` - To-do
- `col-doing` - Doing (Active Work)
- `col-qa` - Ready for QA
- `col-human-in-the-loop` - Human in the Loop
- `col-process-review` - Process Review
- `col-done` - Done
- `col-wont-implement` - Will Not Implement

**Note:** The HAL API endpoint `/api/tickets/move` uses server-side Supabase credentials, so agents don't need to provide credentials in the request body. The API uses the ticket's primary key (pk) for updates to ensure reliable ticket movement regardless of the ticket ID format provided.
