# Agent Instructions (Local)

Instructions are loaded from `.cursor/rules` and `docs/`. See `docs/process/hal-tool-call-contract.mdc` for HAL API endpoints.

## Pre-Commit Build Verification

**MANDATORY:** Before committing ANY code changes, ALL agents **MUST** verify the build succeeds:

1. **Install dependencies (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify TypeScript compilation:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   ```
   
   This must pass with zero errors. If it fails, fix all TypeScript errors before committing.

3. **Verify full build (if making changes that affect build):**
   ```bash
   npm run build:hal
   ```
   
   **Note:** `npm run build:hal` may fail due to vite 6.x scanning node_modules during config loading (pre-existing issue). If this happens, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds instead:
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   ```
   
   If TypeScript compilation fails, you **MUST** fix the errors before committing. Do not commit code that breaks TypeScript compilation.

4. **For specific projects:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/kanban && npx tsc --noEmit  # Check kanban project specifically
   ```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **NEVER commit code without running `npx tsc -b --noEmit` first**
- **NEVER commit code that causes `npm run build:hal` to fail**
- **If build fails, fix it before committing - do not leave broken builds for others to discover**
- This applies to ALL agents (implementation, QA, PM) when making code changes

**This check prevents build failures in CI/CD and ensures code quality.**

## Moving Tickets After Implementation

**MANDATORY:** After implementation, the implementation agent **MUST** automatically move the ticket to **Ready for QA** before sending a completion summary. **DO NOT wait for user interaction or ask for permission - just move it.**

**Move ticket to Ready for QA (AUTOMATIC - NO USER INTERACTION REQUIRED):**
```javascript
const baseUrl = (await readFile('.hal/api-base-url', 'utf8')).trim()
const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/tickets/move`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ticketId: '0167', columnId: 'col-qa' }),
})
const result = await res.json()
if (!result.success) {
  // If missing artifacts, store them and retry
  if (result.missingArtifacts && Array.isArray(result.missingArtifacts)) {
    // Store missing artifacts, then retry move
    // (implementation details in error handling below)
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Failed to move ticket: ${result.error}`)
  }
}
```

**When to move (AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW - NO USER INTERACTION):**
1. ✅ After all code changes are committed and pushed
2. ✅ After all 8 required artifacts are stored (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review, git-diff, instructions-used)
3. ✅ **Automatically call get_artifacts** (or POST /api/artifacts/get) and confirm all 8 required implementation artifacts are present with substantive content
4. ✅ **AUTOMATICALLY MOVE THE TICKET TO READY FOR QA** (use the API call above) - **DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY, DO NOT ASK USER**
5. ✅ **THEN** send your final "implementation complete" summary message

**Error Handling for Ticket Move:**
- **If move returns success: false with missingArtifacts:** Automatically store each listed artifact via POST /api/artifacts/insert-implementation with the corresponding artifactType, then automatically retry POST /api/tickets/move. The move API will not allow moving to Ready for QA until all 8 artifacts are present.
- **If move fails for other reasons:** Log the error, but **STILL ATTEMPT TO MOVE**. The system is designed to handle failures gracefully. Do not block completion - move the ticket and note any issues in your summary.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:** 
- **ALWAYS move the ticket automatically** - never ask the user for permission or wait for confirmation
- **DO NOT** send a completion summary or "done" message without first moving the ticket to Ready for QA
- **DO NOT** mark the ticket as complete in your message if you haven't moved it
- The ticket move is **part of the completion workflow**, not an optional step
- **If the move fails, retry automatically** - do not give up after one failure
- **The system is designed to handle failures** - if a move fails, it's okay, just note it and move on

**Available column IDs:**
- `col-unassigned` - Unassigned
- `col-todo` - To-do
- `col-doing` - Doing (Active Work)
- `col-qa` - Ready for QA
- `col-human-in-the-loop` - Human in the Loop
- `col-process-review` - Process Review
- `col-done` - Done
- `col-wont-implement` - Will Not Implement

**Note:** The HAL API endpoint `/api/tickets/move` uses server-side Supabase credentials, so agents don't need to provide credentials in the request body. The API uses the ticket's primary key (pk) for updates to ensure reliable ticket movement regardless of the ticket ID format provided.
