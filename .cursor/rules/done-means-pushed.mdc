# “Done” Means Committed + Pushed (All Agents)

- **FORBIDDEN:** Sending a "done" or summary message while the working tree has uncommitted/unpushed changes. Commit and push first; then summarize.

## Start of task: feature branch first (prevents lost work)

- **MANDATORY:** Before making **any** file changes for a ticket, create/checkout the feature branch. This is non-negotiable. See also **no-edits-on-main.mdc**.
- **Required first step** (before the first edit):
  1. Run `git status -sb`. Note the current branch.
  2. If you are on **`main`**: do **not** use StrReplace, Write, or EditNotebook. Run `git checkout -b ticket/<id>-<short-title-kebab>` (or `git checkout ticket/<id>-...` if it exists remotely) first.
  3. If **branch creation or checkout fails** (e.g. cloud or restricted workspace), follow **cloud-and-restricted-agent-workflow.mdc**: you may proceed on current HEAD and must not claim "done" or "ready for QA"; report a change summary so the user can create the branch and push elsewhere.
  4. Feature branch name: `ticket/<id>-<short-title-kebab>` (e.g. ticket 0030 → `ticket/0030-ticket-list-add-delete-button-and-sync-deletion-to-filesystem`).
  5. Only after you are on the feature branch (or following the restricted workflow) may you edit files.
- **FORBIDDEN:** Implementing ticket work on `main` when you **can** create a feature branch. If you realize you edited on `main`: run `git checkout -b ticket/<id>-...` — uncommitted changes move with you; commit on the feature branch. If branch creation failed, see **cloud-and-restricted-agent-workflow.mdc**.
- **Why:** Edits on `main` conflate work, can be lost on stash/reset, and violate branching policy. Branch first when possible.

## Branching policy (feature branches required)

- For ticketed work, agents must work on a **feature branch**, not directly on `main`.
  - Branch naming: `ticket/<id>-<short-title-kebab>` (example: `ticket/0003-hal-chat-hal-agents`).
- “Ready / done” requires:
  - the feature branch is **pushed** to remote, and
  - `git status -sb` shows the branch is **synced** and the working tree is **clean**.

## Do not merge to main (implementation agent)

- When an agent believes a ticket is ready, they must **commit and push their feature branch to GitHub** — and **must not merge to `main`**. QA performs code review + automated verification (no manual UI testing), then merges to main and moves the ticket to Human in the Loop for user testing. The implementation agent must add the branch name to the ticket (see ticket template), then may claim “ready/done.”
- Sequence:
  - verify feature branch is clean and pushed to remote
  - **add the branch name to the ticket** (see ticket template: QA → Branch)
  - then send the completion/summary message including the branch name and `git status -sb`
- The implementation agent **must** add the branch name to the ticket so QA knows which branch to review and merge.

## Sequence: push first, then summarize

- The moment you **think** you're done (implementation complete, audit written, etc.) is when you **commit and push** — not after you've already told the user.
- **First:** commit all relevant changes, **push the feature branch** to GitHub (do not merge to `main`), and **add the branch name to the ticket**.
- **Then:** tell the user what was done (summary, verification, audit location, **branch name**). Do not give the long "here's what I did" report until after push + ticket update.
- If you summarize first and then commit/push (or forget to add the branch to the ticket), you did it in the wrong order.

## Before you reply: the gate

- **If you are about to send a message** that summarizes completed work, or that includes any of: "done", "complete", "ready", "looks good", "here's what I did", "Implementation complete", "Summary:", or similar — **STOP**.
- **First** run: `git status -sb`. If there are any `M` (modified) or `??` (untracked) relevant to the task: run `git add`, `git commit -m '...'` (with ticket ID in subject), and `git push` (feature branch only; do not merge to main). **Add the branch name to the ticket** (QA → Branch). Then run `git status -sb` again.
- **Only after** the working tree is clean, the feature branch is pushed, and the **branch name is added to the ticket** may you send that message — and your message **must** include the **branch name** and the exact `git status -sb` output.
- If you have not yet committed and pushed, do **not** send a "done" or summary message; do the commit and push in this same turn, then reply.

## Requirements

- If any agent believes a task/story is **done**, they must:
  - **commit** all relevant changes, and
  - **push** to the remote
  before telling the user or project manager that it’s done.
- Agents must not delegate commit/push work to the user/PM (e.g., “after you commit and push…”).
  - If commit/push hasn’t happened yet, the correct status is **“not ready for verification.”**
- “Done/ready” messages must include the **feature branch name** (so QA can check out and verify) and the exact `git status -sb` output showing the branch is synced and the working tree is clean.
  - “Clean” means: **no modified files** and **no untracked files** (ignored build artifacts are fine).

## Commit message linkage (no commit hashes in docs)

- Every commit that belongs to a ticket must include the ticket ID in the commit subject (e.g. `feat(0010): ...`, `fix(0008): ...`, `docs(0009): ...`).
- If a ticket requires follow-up commits after an initial “feat/fix” commit, those follow-up commits must also include the same ticket ID in the subject.
  - Do not “sneak in” ticket work under unlabeled commits like `chore: ...` if it still belongs to the ticket.
- If `git status -sb` is not clean/synced, the agent must say **“not ready for verification”** and keep working until it is.
  - Do not claim “ready” if `git status` shows any `??` (untracked) or `M` (modified) entries.

## PM verification

- The project manager’s “done” is only **candidate-complete** until the user verifies the acceptance criteria.
- Do not use language like “done” or “complete” until changes are committed and pushed.
