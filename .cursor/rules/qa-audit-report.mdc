# QA Audit Report (QA Agents)

When you **QA a ticket** (e.g. user asks to "QA", "verify", or "check" a ticket that is allegedly complete), you **must** store a QA report in Supabase via HAL's API endpoints.

## Cloud QA workflow context

In cloud environments, QA agents may not have access to feature branches (only `main`). When this is the case, the implementation agent merges the feature branch to `main` before QA begins. QA must then verify from `main` rather than attempting to check out a feature branch. This workflow is indicated when the ticket states "merged to `main` for QA access" or similar language.

## Which branch to use (decision rule)

- **If the ticket or prompt states that the implementation was "merged to main for QA access"** (or that code is on `main` for QA): 
  - You **must** verify from the **`main`** branch. 
  - Do **not** attempt to locate, check out, or use the feature branch.
  - **Step 1:** Pull the latest `main` branch: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
  - **Step 2:** Perform QA on `main` (code review and verification).
  - **Step 3:** Record in the QA report that verification was performed against `main` (e.g. "Verified on `main`; implementation was merged to main for QA access.").
  - **Step 4:** Store the QA report in Supabase via HAL API (see "Storing QA report" below).
  - **Step 5:** Move ticket to Human in the Loop via HAL API, then provide summary.
- **Otherwise:** use the feature branch named in the ticket's QA → Branch field (or the branch you were launched on). Perform QA on that branch, then follow the full workflow (merge to main, delete branch, etc.).

**Important:** When QA cannot access feature branches (cloud QA workflow), the implementation agent merges the feature branch to `main` before QA. In this case, QA must verify from `main` and record this in the QA report stored in Supabase.

## Required artifact

- **Storage:** Supabase `agent_artifacts` table (via HAL API endpoint `/api/artifacts/insert-qa`)
- **When:** After performing QA (code review and, if possible, UI verification) for a ticket.
- **Agent type:** `qa`
- **Title format:** `QA report for ticket <ticket-id>`

## QA report structure

1. **Ticket & deliverable** — One-line goal, deliverable, and acceptance criteria from the ticket.
2. **Audit artifacts** — Confirm all required implementation artifacts are present in Supabase (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review).
3. **Code review** — PASS/FAIL with brief evidence (e.g. table of requirement vs implementation; file and line refs if helpful).
4. **UI verification** — What was run: automated and/or manual steps. If automated UI was not run (e.g. native dialogs, login, or pickers), state that and list the manual steps the user should run.
5. **Verdict** — Implementation complete? OK to merge? Any blocking manual verification?

## Storing QA report

**Send a tool call to HAL in your message:**

Include this JSON block in your message:

```json
{
  "tool": "insert_qa_artifact",
  "params": {
    "ticketId": "0076",
    "title": "QA report for ticket 0076",
    "body_md": "# QA Report\n\n..."
  }
}
```

HAL will parse this from your message, execute it, and store the artifact in Supabase. You don't need API URLs or credentials - just include the JSON in your message.

## QA completion: do not hand off to the user

When the verdict is **PASS (OK to merge)**, QA must **complete the full workflow** — do not stop at a summary or "next steps for the user."

## Completion message format requirement

**MANDATORY:** The final completion message to the user **must** include the ticket ID and an explicit PASS/FAIL outcome token in a consistent, easy-to-spot format.

- **Format:** `QA RESULT: <PASS|FAIL> — <ticket-id>`
- **Examples:**
  - `QA RESULT: PASS — 0056`
  - `QA RESULT: FAIL — 0056`
- **Placement:** This must appear in the final summary message that QA sends to the user after completing all workflow steps (merge, branch deletion, ticket updates, etc.).
- **Why:** HAL needs to reliably parse QA outcomes from chat transcripts. The format must be human-verifiable (no external tooling required) and consistently structured for automated interpretation.
- **Verification:** A human can read the QA chat transcript in the app and immediately see the ticket ID and outcome without parsing complex prose.

**If you are verifying from the feature branch** (normal workflow):

1. **Store QA report in Supabase** — Include a tool call in your message:
   ```json
   {
     "tool": "insert_qa_artifact",
     "params": {
       "ticketId": "0076",
       "title": "QA report for ticket 0076",
       "body_md": "# QA Report\n\n..."
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Update ticket body** (optional) — If needed, include a tool call to update the ticket body:
   ```json
   {
     "tool": "update_ticket_body",
     "params": {
       "ticketId": "0076",
       "body_md": "# Updated ticket body..."
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Move ticket to Human in the Loop** — Include a tool call:
   ```json
   {
     "tool": "move_ticket_column",
     "params": {
       "ticketId": "0076",
       "columnId": "col-human-in-the-loop"
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Merge to main** — checkout `main`, merge the feature branch, push `main`.
5. **Delete the feature branch** — local and remote (see `delete-branch-after-merge.mdc`).
6. **Then** give your summary to the user. **The final message must include:** `QA RESULT: PASS — <ticket-id>` (see "Completion message format requirement" above).

**If you are verifying from `main`** (implementation was merged to main for QA access):

1. **Store QA report in Supabase** — Include a tool call in your message. Include a note in the report that verification was performed against `main`.
2. **Update ticket body** (optional) — If needed, include a tool call to note that verification was performed against `main`.
3. **Move ticket to Human in the Loop** — Include a tool call to move the ticket.
4. **Then** give your summary to the user. **The final message must include:** `QA RESULT: PASS — <ticket-id>` (see "Completion message format requirement" above).

Do not give a summary with "next steps" or "run these commands" — QA performs the merge (or confirms main) and branch deletion where applicable. The user receives the completed result.

- Use a commit subject that includes the ticket ID (e.g. `qa(0033): add QA report, move to Human in the Loop`).
- **If verdict is FAIL:** Do not merge. Store the QA report in Supabase only; summarize findings and recommend a bugfix ticket (see `bugfix-tracking.mdc`). **The final message must include:** `QA RESULT: FAIL — <ticket-id>` (see "Completion message format requirement" above).

## HAL Tool Call Contract

All Supabase operations are sent to HAL as **tool calls** in your messages. HAL parses and executes them automatically.

**Available tools:**

- **`insert_qa_artifact`** — Store QA report in Supabase
  - Params: `{ ticketId: string, title: string, body_md: string }`

- **`update_ticket_body`** — Update ticket body in Supabase
  - Params: `{ ticketId: string, body_md: string }`

- **`move_ticket_column`** — Move ticket to different column
  - Params: `{ ticketId: string, columnId: string }`

- **`get_ticket_content`** — Fetch ticket content
  - Params: `{ ticketId: string }`

**How to use:** Include tool calls as JSON blocks in your messages. HAL will parse and execute them. You don't need API URLs or credentials.

See `.cursor/rules/agent-supabase-api-paradigm.mdc` for full documentation.

## Scope

- Applies to any QA or verification of a **ticketed** task (ticket in Supabase).
- Keep the report concise; use bullets and tables where appropriate.
- All artifacts are stored in Supabase, not in `docs/audit/` folders.
