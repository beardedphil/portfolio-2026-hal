# QA Audit Report (QA Agents)

When you **QA a ticket** (e.g. user asks to "QA", "verify", or "check" a ticket that is allegedly complete), you **must** add a QA report to that ticket’s audit folder.

## Required artifact

- **Path:** `docs/audit/<task-id>-<short-title>/qa-report.md`
- **When:** After performing QA (code review and, if possible, UI verification) for a ticket.

## qa-report.md structure

1. **Ticket & deliverable** — One-line goal, deliverable, and acceptance criteria from the ticket.
2. **Audit artifacts** — Confirm all required audit files are present (plan, worklog, changed-files, decisions, verification, pm-review).
3. **Code review** — PASS/FAIL with brief evidence (e.g. table of requirement vs implementation; file and line refs if helpful).
4. **UI verification** — What was run: automated and/or manual steps from `verification.md`. If automated UI was not run (e.g. native dialogs, login, or pickers), state that and list the manual steps the user should run.
5. **Verdict** — Implementation complete? OK to merge? Any blocking manual verification?

## Example location

For ticket `docs/tickets/0026-kanban-tickets-persist-column-on-refresh.md`, the QA report is:

`docs/audit/0026-kanban-tickets-persist-column-on-refresh/qa-report.md`

## Commit and push before summary

- **You must commit and push** the qa-report (and any rule changes) **before** sending your QA summary to the user.
- Sequence: write `qa-report.md` → commit all QA artifacts (report + rule updates if any) → push → then give your summary. Do not summarize first and then commit/push.
- Use a commit subject that includes the ticket ID (e.g. `docs(0026): add QA report and qa-audit-report rule`).

## Scope

- Applies to any QA or verification of a **ticketed** task (ticket under `docs/tickets/` with a matching folder under `docs/audit/`).
- Keep the report concise; use bullets and tables where appropriate.
