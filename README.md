# Portfolio 2026 — HAL (Super Project)

This repo assembles the portfolio projects. **Edit agents code only here** so there is a single source of truth.

## Projects

- `projects/kanban` — Project 0 (kanban board), **git submodule**
- `projects/hal-agents` — PM/agents (hal-agents), **normal directory** — edit here only; HAL always uses this copy

See [docs/process/single-source-agents.md](docs/process/single-source-agents.md) for why hal-agents is in-repo and how to optionally sync to an external repo.
